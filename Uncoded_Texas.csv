Since our founding in 1993, our mission has been to develop, maintain, and preserve equestrian trails while promoting responsible trail use and safety through volunteering, education and membership.

Our goal is simple: to allow the maximum number of people to enjoy the beautiful trails of our area on horseback!
CTETA volunteers maintain more than 25 miles of trails here in North Texas. The work of our trail ambassadors helps to create a safe experience for our riders and includes clearing deadfall, cutting back brush, and mowing the grass. Without us, many of these trails would cease to exist entirely. 

As with most government agencies, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is faced with cutbacks and limited funds for trail improvements. Club membership dues can only go so far. Therefore, it is important to have a strong membership base, not only for funds to support the trail maintenance, but for education and a continued strong voice in local matters of trail preservation and acquisition of land for connecting trails.

In our early days, we were proud to be supported by Eleanor Keaton, Buster’s widow, who attended several of our events. Today, we are thrilled to have Melissa Talmadge Cox, Buster’s grand-daughter, on our board, and Keaton Talmadge, his great-grand-daughter as an active member. We are an entirely volunteer-operated group, we love what we do, and are honored to help maintain Buster’s legacy. We hope that you will use the resources of this website, our social media presence, and the Society in general to learn more about the art of Buster Keaton. We also look forward to seeing how Keaton inspires you in your own life and work. We also hope that you’ll support us by becoming a member, which gives you access to the amazing Keaton Chronicle and store discounts.
