CTETA volunteers maintain more than 25 miles of trails here in North Texas. The work of our trail ambassadors helps to create a safe experience for our riders and includes clearing deadfall, cutting back brush, and mowing the grass. Without us, many of these trails would cease to exist entirely. 

As with most government agencies, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is faced with cutbacks and limited funds for trail improvements. Club membership dues can only go so far.
